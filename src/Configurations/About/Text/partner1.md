### Snite Museum of Art
The Snite Museum of Art, University of Notre Dame, is founded on the principle that art is essential to understanding individual, shared, and diverse human experiences and beliefs. The permanent collection features over 29,000 artworks. Major collection strengths include Mesoamerican art, old master paintings and drawings, nineteenth-century French art, nineteenth-century photography, and the art of Ivan Mestrovic.  Our holdings also include Native American, Latino, African, African-American, and contemporary art.
